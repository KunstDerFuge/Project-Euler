# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is
# that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If
# this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
# diagonals first falls below 10%?
