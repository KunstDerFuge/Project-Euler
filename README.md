# Project Euler

### What is Project Euler?
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a website that publishes math / number theory problems that can, and usually must, be solved with the 
help of a computer.

### What's this for?
This repository is primarily a place to keep my own solutions in one place, but may also be a good resource to show a 
future potential employer that I'm not completely incompetent.

If you intend to solve these problems for yourself, I strongly suggest not looking through these solutions. Try 
researching the problem domain instead.

### Goal
While I solved the first 50 problems in C++ around 2015, I'd like to solve at least the first 100 in Python. I want to 
grow as a developer and a learner!
