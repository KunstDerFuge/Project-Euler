# Project Euler

## What is Project Euler?
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a website that publishes math / number theory problems that can, and usually must, be solved with the 
help of a computer.

## What's this for?
This repository is primarily a place to keep my own solutions in one place, but may also be a good resource to show a 
future potential employer that I'm not completely incompetent.

If you intend to solve these problems for yourself, I strongly suggest not looking through these solutions. Try 
researching the problem domain instead. You may also fork this repo, delete all ###.py files and empty out utilities.py,
and use generate_progress.py to show off your own progress!

## Goal
While I solved the first 50 problems in C++ around 2015, I'd like to solve at least the first 100 in Python. I want to 
grow as a developer and a learner!

Project Euler defines the success condition of a program as finishing in less than one minute on a standard computer. In
the table below, solutions that run longer than 30 or 60 seconds are italicized or bold, respectively. I've also
designated these as 'suboptimal solutions'. That's not to say that the quick ones are 'optimal solutions', because they
may in fact still be brute-force solutions. My secondary goal is to gradually optimize all solutions.

## Progress
### 67 / 100 Complete!

6 suboptimal solutions
